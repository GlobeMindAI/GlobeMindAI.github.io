title: UAV-assisted Computation Task Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Vehicular Edge Computing Scenarios.

summary: UAV-assisted Computation Task Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Vehicular Edge Computing Scenarios.
abstract: 'The rapid advancement of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and the proliferation of autonomous vehicles have fueled the need for more efficient edge computing solutions to handle real-time computation tasks. Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is emerging as a solution to address this demand by offloading computational tasks from vehicles to edge nodes, reducing latency and improving decision-making in driving scenarios. However, the mobility of both vehicles and edge nodes introduces significant challenges for resource allocation and task scheduling. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising avenue to supplement traditional edge computing infrastructure by providing mobile, flexible, and on-demand computation resources. This research aims to develop novel algorithms for UAV-assisted task scheduling and resource allocation, specifically tailored for VEC scenarios.

The increasing computational needs of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are putting immense pressure on the existing cloud infrastructure, which is often plagued by latency issues. VEC aims to reduce this burden by placing computational capabilities closer to the vehicle network, but it is still limited by the geographic distribution and static nature of edge servers. UAVs can serve as an adaptive layer in VEC, offering the ability to dynamically deploy computational resources where they are needed the most.

In VEC scenarios, vehicles frequently move between different coverage areas of edge nodes, resulting in task offloading challenges and fluctuations in computational load. UAVs, with their flexible mobility, can be deployed to alleviate these issues by serving as temporary, on-demand computation units. However, the challenge lies in efficiently coordinating task scheduling and resource allocation between the mobile UAVs, static edge nodes, and vehicles, all while maintaining low-latency and energy-efficient operations.'
