title: Enhancing Robustness in Autonomous Driving: Sensing, Perception, and Planning Under Adverse Geological Conditions





summary: An example event.
abstract: 'Autonomous driving technology has advanced rapidly, but its reliability is still challenged by adverse geological conditions such as heavy rain, snow, fog, and rough terrains. These conditions can significantly hinder the effectiveness of sensing, perception, and planning algorithms, which are crucial for safe navigation. This research aims to investigate and enhance the robustness of autonomous driving systems under these challenging environments.

Existing autonomous driving systems often rely on optimal weather conditions for accurate functioning. However, geological variability can lead to performance degradation. Previous studies have shown the potential for machine learning and sensor fusion to mitigate these challenges, but comprehensive approaches combining these elements in real-world scenarios remain limited.



The proposed research will span over three years with a budget allocated for equipment, personnel, and field testing. A detailed budget breakdown and timeline will be provided upon request.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
