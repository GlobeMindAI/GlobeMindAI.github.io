Upon successful completion, students will receive a jointly conferred PhD degree from both universities, requiring only one dissertation defense. Additionally, tuition fees at the University of Warwick will be waived, and students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University may apply for CSC scholarships. The program encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including but not limited to Humanities, Sciences, Social Sciences, and Low Carbon, based on the subject areas available at the partner university.
