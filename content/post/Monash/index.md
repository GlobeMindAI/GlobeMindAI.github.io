The Monash Warwick Alliance Joint PhD is part of our commitment to developing a successor generation of internationally experienced young researchers. For joint-research teams the contribution of outstanding, highly mobile PhD candidates brings additional capacity to support research collaboration. Alliance Joint PhD candidates, along with post-doctoral researchers, have a unique opportunity to play a key role in the collaboration between teams on opposite sides of the world.

The Alliance Joint PhD enables you to study at two innovative and internationally renowned institutions. You will spend a minimum of one year at Warwick and a minimum of one year at any of Monash's Australian campuses. Travel to the other institution usually occurs in the second year.

Guided by a supervisor at each institution, you will be able to carry out work of the highest calibre, in the company of an elite group of academics and postgraduate researchers. As well as contributing to your field of research, you will engage in personal, professional and academic training delivered by colleagues with expert knowledge of the demands of the global job market.

The Alliance Joint PhD will enable you to build strong networks in different parts of the globe and gain exposure to different research and working cultures, developing demonstrable intercultural competencies to enhance your future career prospects.
