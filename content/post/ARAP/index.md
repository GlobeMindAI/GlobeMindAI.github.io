Warwick A*STAR Research Attachment Programme (ARAP)
<!--more-->

The Warwick - A*STAR Research Attachment Programme offers fully funded 4 year PhD studentships in Interdisciplinary Research, with students spending 2 years at Warwick and 2 years in Singapore at an A*STAR institute.

How it works
Students are jointly supervised by a Warwick and an A*STAR supervisor.
Pairs of supervisors in Warwick and Singapore propose joint projects with the experimental work divided between the student's time in their Warwick lab and their Singapore lab.
Prospective students are encouraged to approach prospective supervisors to discuss projects.

How to apply
The deadline for applications for 2024/25 is 12 April 2024. Please send a CV, covering letter, personal statement and two reference letters to arap@warwick.ac.uk. Interviews will likely take place by the end of April.
