-Lawrence Wu is an interdisciplinary scholar specializing in diamond color centers, condensed matter physics, and quantum sensing. He received the De Beers Scholarship at the University of Warwick, where he led the project “Identification of defects in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR),” and earned his PhD in Physics in 2023. Recognized for his outstanding work across disciplines, he was awarded an Early Career Fellowship by Warwick's Institute of Advanced Study. He also served as a Research Fellow at Warwick’s Department of Physics, leading a project titled "In-situ characterization of nano-structure silicon defects in heavily doped diamond using aberration-corrected TEM."
-Currently, Lawrence holds a Research Fellow position at PSL University in Paris and the CNRS, supported by ERS funding. His ongoing project, "Hybrid Materials for Quantum Sensing," integrates expertise in condensed matter physics, quantum technology, and material synthesis.
