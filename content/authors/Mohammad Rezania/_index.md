Dr. Mohammad Rezania obtained B.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2002, my M.Sc. degree in Geotechnical Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology in 2004, and my PhD in Geotechnical Engineering from University of Exeter in 2008.

After my PhD graduation, I worked as postdoctoral researcher on a number of industry/academia projects at several institutions across Europe including University of Strathclyde in the UK, Plaxis BV in the Netherlands, and Aalto University in Finland. In 2013 I was appointed Assistant Professor in Geomechanics in the Department of Civil Engineering at University of Nottingham. In 2017, I joined University of Warwick as Associate Professor in Civil Engineering and promoted to Reader in 2021. In 2019 I was also conferred an Honorary Professor at the Southwest Jiaotong University in China. I am the PI and Coordinator of the ‘MINRESCUE’ project (EC-RFCS - link to webpageLink opens in a new window) to develop new solutions for valorisation of mining wastes in construction industry where I lead a team of twelve universities and industry partners across Europe.
His research focuses on multivariate modelling/AI prediction/probabilistic analysis in geoscience, specifically for failure analysis and risk assessment of granular flows, avalanches, and natural hazards. Derek develops robust statistical numerical algorithms through the integration of Computational Statistics and Data Science to quantitatively evaluate the uncertainties of granular flows in heterogeneous materials that exhibit significant randomness.

My main research interests are in resources and energy geotechnics and geomaterials/geostructures modelling. The main focus is applied research on addressing the most challenging practical issues that industry faces when dealing with the behaviour of different geo/construction materials, from plastic clays to porous materials and rocks, to materials that do not have the typical characteristics of soils, e.g. mortars or mining wastes.
