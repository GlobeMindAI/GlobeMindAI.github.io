 Ze Zhou Wang is currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow at the University of Cambridge, serving as the principal investigator of a research project funded by the European Union and UK Research and Innovation. His research is at the intersection of infrastructure sensing, computational modelling, data science, artificial intelligence, reliability, geotechnical/infrastructure engineering. His current fellowship project at the University of Cambridge aims to utilize both historical performance data and continuous monitoring data to advance the understanding of how climate, microclimate, traffic, and natural hazards interactively impact England's road assets. He will then provide recommendations for maintenance and repair decisions that balance cost, carbon and environmental benefits.

Prior to Cambridge, Dr. Wang holds both a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering and a doctorate in geotechnical engineering from the National University of Singapore and was a visiting researcher under Prof. Andrew Whittle at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his doctoral research, he developed and implemented a range of self-compatible computational techniques to streamline sensor data interpretation for construction safety control and decision-making. In his subsequent independent research, he pioneered the integration of deep-learning algorithms into geotechnical reliability analyses. In his previous postdoctoral research, he developed innovative machine-learning algorithms to integrate geological features into the numerical reconstruction of geological subsurface stratigraphy. At present, results from his research led to 17 articles in leading international journals, such as ASCE Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 11 conference papers and two software. He was also the recipient of the best paper award from 8th International Symposium for Geotechnical Safety & Risk in Australia. Notably, the software he developed in hisresearch is now being employed by government agencies for ongoing construction projects in Singapore.
