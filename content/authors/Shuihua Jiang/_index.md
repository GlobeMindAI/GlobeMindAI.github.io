Prof. Jiang is the professor in Nanchang University, he focuses on the reliability analysis and risk control of geotechnical engineering in hydraulic and hydroelectric projects. It includes parameter variability characterization, non-intrusive stochastic finite element methods for slope reliability, Bayesian updates, stochastic fracture network modifications, and assessments for complex structures (high slopes, levees, tailings dams, tunnels). The researcher has led over 10 projects funded by organizations like the National Natural Science Foundation of China, published two books and 100+ papers.
