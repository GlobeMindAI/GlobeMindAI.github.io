Wenhao Li is a joint Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil Engineering at Tianjin University also in University of Warwick, specializing in geotechnical engineering and deep-sea energy soil research. His research focuses on the micromechanical properties of deep-sea energy soils, disaster engineering analysis, and probabilistic methods for risk prevention. He has a particular interest in applying deep learning techniques to study the spatial variability of deep-sea soils and the geological risks associated with natural gas hydrate extraction.
